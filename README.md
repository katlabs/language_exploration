# Language Exploration Project

First install the requirements.
```shell
pip install requirements.txt (preferably in a virtual environment)
```

The project can be opened with jupyter lab or your favorite IDE that works with jupyter enviroments.
```shell
jupyter lab
```

Start with Main.ipynb, which is a markdown only overview of the project that links to relevant sections of the code-based notebooks. Not all of the code will run if the system does not have sufficient RAM, but you can see the process through the Main notebook and the cell contents of the other notebooks.
